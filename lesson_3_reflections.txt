Q1:
=====
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

While collaborating with other developers. This feature is useful because
it allows developers to collaborate and work simultaneously on the same file.
=====

Q:2
=====
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling changes manually allows for greater control. Being able to
decide when to sync a 'remote' with a 'local' repository gives the developer
the possibility to choose how to proceed.
=====

Q:3
=====
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Branches:
Operates on a local repository, allowing to differentiate a project or make
experimental changes without affecting the main project.

Clones:
Operates on a local or remote repository. It allows to duplicate a local
repository or to clone a remote repository on GitHub on your local
machine. It is possible to clone a forked project using the provided link
that is present on the respective GitHub page.

Forks:
Operates only on a remote repository on GitHub. It allows to duplicate
a repository of another developer into your own GitHub space. This method
keeps track of who has forked the project, as well as maintain a reference
to the original developer. By invoking this command on GitHub generates automatically a remote repository called 'origin'. 
=====

Q:4
=====
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

When collaborating with other peoples, this feature is very useful because
it allows asynchronous development from various collaborators. The changes
made by a collaborator on a remote repository can be imported locally, 
using the fetch command, to the local origin/master branch (which keeps 
track of the last known state of the remote) without having an impact on 
the master local branch. Then these changes can be merged afterwards into
the local master branch. One useful reason would be when developing
locally without internet access, if a collaborator make changes on the
remote version, then these changes can be fetched when the net becomes available again.
