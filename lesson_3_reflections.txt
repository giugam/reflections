Q1:
=====
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

While collaborating with other developers. This feature is useful because
it allows developers to collaborate and work simultaneously on the same file.

Q:2
=====
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling changes manually allows for greater control. Being able to
decide when to sync a 'remote' with a 'local' repository gives the developer
the possibility to choose how to proceed.
