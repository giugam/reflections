Q1:
=====
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The folder becomes a repository and git adds metadata to track changes
to this repository and the files contained in it. This should be done
otherwise no tracking will be done. This can be done off line.
=====

Q:2
=====
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The 'staging area' is a temporary container which allows to collect one
or more files that will form part of a commit. The' working
area' contains all the files, even those that might never be commited.
The 'repository' instead consists of the collection of both entities and
keeps track of what is in the working directory, and what is in the
staging area, ready to be commited, and once files will be commited
these will form one logical group in one commit.
=====

Q:3
=====
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per
logical change?

The 'staging area' can be populated using 'git add modified_file.xxx'.
All the updated files can be added in this way. In case some
time has passed, to find out which changes have been made, it is
possible to use 'git diff' to find out the differences between the
working area and the staging area, or the 'git diff -staged' to find
out the differences between the staging area and the most recent
commit.
=====

Q:4
=====
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping
your history organized? How would branches help?

'Branches' are lables to provide an independed new line of changes,
whether this refers to try out an experimental change or for example to
introduce a new feature.
It is possible to 'checkout' (reposition) into different branches, the
last commit of a branch is referred to as the 'tip' of that branch. 
The standard branch is the 'master' branch. Branches can also be merged
into the main stem or master branch. Being able to give
self-explenatory names to branches allows us to identify them more
easily, enabling us to join logically a series of commit into a branch.
